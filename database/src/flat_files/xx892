                     at the age of 2 years with petechiae. Investigations
                     showed microangiopathic haemolysis associated with
                     thrombocytopenia. There was no neurological manifestation.
                     She subsequently had a total 8 similar attacks from
                     1996-1999, which were precipitated by upper respiratory
                     tract infection. Recovery was usually spontaneous or
                     following FFP infusion plus or minus oral steroids. She
                     was now 10 years old and was the only child of the family.
