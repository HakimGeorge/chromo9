                     presented as neonatal thrombocytopenia after birth with a
                     platelet count of 15 X 10^9/L, associated with severe
                     neonatal jaundice necessitating exchange transfusion. She
                     was re-admitted at 5 months of age with petechiae. The
                     platelet count was reduced to 10 X 10^9/L and bone marrow
                     examination showed active trilineage haemopoiesis. A
                     presumptive diagnosis of acute immune thrombocytopenic
                     purpura was made and intravenous immunoglobulins were
                     tried. She was again re-admitted at 12 months of age with
                     petechiae associated with flu-like symptoms and fever.
                     Investigations showed anaemia and
                     thrombocytopenia,reticulocytosis of 11%, and a
                     microangiopathic blood picture with 5% schistocytes. The
                     clotting profile was normal. The diagnosis was revised to
                     probable recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
                     (TTP). There were several subsequent relapses that
                     responded to fresh frozen plasma infusion (FFP). She was
                     now 29 months of age. She had a younger brother, now 6
                     months of age, who ran a similar clinical course in the
                     neonatal period."
